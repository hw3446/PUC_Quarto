4,2,,2,,,2,1,1,1,Br1;Br4,At times I was too distracted by the hands of the pianist and the intense emotions of the viola player. Br1: The first movement made me think of the ocean sea and its many moods from quietly lapping to a raging storm.,3,2,2,Br1;Br4,,3,2,2,,
5,1,1,1,5,1,5,5,1,3,Br1,I remembered times when I played the piece myself,5,5,5,Br1,No fictional story,1,1,1,,
6,2,2,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,Br2,,,,,Br2,"I imagined sheep as the music started, and their wooly bodies were quite vivid and lifelike",3,5,3,,"I found it interesting to categorize my inner musings as memories, plans for the future, fictitious musings and everyday stuff. Often, these become intertwined as the memories morph into new concepts and ideas for the future"
7,4,2,2,4,2,5,4,4,5,Br2,My relaxing wonderful lunch with my daughter on Sunday. Afterwards- out talking to the aary,4,5,5,Br4,Definitely a frantic search for something important,5,5,5,,

9,1,2,1,3,1,3,2,1,2,Br3,The scherzo has been one of my favorite pieces since I was a teenager and I listen to it often. The last time I saw it performed was by faculty at a summer music camp I attended when I was 16. I kept thinking about the summer camp even though those memories in general don't 'match' the music. ,5,4,4,,No ficional thoughts that I remember,,,,,
10,3,,,2,,2,,,,Br3,,,,,Br3,"The opening of the Scherzo brought to mind a scene of people fleeing by night through a wav-torn landscape. But the major section following brought to mind people marching proudly by dat. The alternation of there themes grew to suggest an entire population, a national struggle of some kind. The finale continued their feeling. ",4,5,3,,
11,4,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,Br3,Thought about my own experiences performing in concert band. Very easy to sway along/ move to the tempo of the beat. Brahms holds a place in my mind -- I remember playing autumn-inspired piece (don't remember it's name unfortunately) in high school. Brahms ... holds a very melodramatic space in my head. ,4,4,4,Br2,"A story of the future --a nurse gets called to a mission in space (have no clue why, I just like the visual). She's blasted into space, there's visual spectacle of all the shapes and stars and galaxies",4,4,4,,"As someone who treasures creativity, I enjoy this exercise, as it allows for a spontaneous burst of thought. Classical music is always going to be an exercise of emotion (amongst other, more rigorous things). I think this was a good way to consciously engage yourself in the concert -- encourage more of a commitment to insert yourself into the music."
12,3,1,2,1,1,5,1,1,1,,,,,,Br2; Br3,Br2: Romantic conversation in flower/plant conversations/ Riverside; Br3: a card game disagreement! ,5,5,4,3rd and 4th had horse racing/galloping moments,

17,1,1,2,2,1,5,2,3,2,,Nope! I was entirely focused on the music or distracted by minor nonsense in the space. ,,,,,"Nope! No ""imaginings"" or none that were significant enough to stick around. Too engrossed",,,,"The syncopated 3rd mvt was so engrossing and the tempo was so fast - super engrossed and on the edge of my seat. Sorry, no memories or ""imaginings"" during the second half of the concert - too engrossed!",Big time framing effect - had lots of meta thoughts. People with clipboards made distracting noises.

Very vivid, felt very ancient ",5,5,4,,Everyone who took part in the survey is cool and beautiful and a genius and I am in no way biased as a music department student!

Just a very tense movement, so made me think of walking on a balance beam...",,,,,,5,2,3,"In this piece, I was entirely focused on the music and the performers.

24,1,,1,2,1,4,1,1,2,Br3,"The rapid rhythm of the music brought back a memory of dancing wildly around -- as well as a ranch experience. Unlike the first half of the program however, the Brahms did not evoke much ""imagining"". ",2,2,2,Br3,Again the rapid rhythm prompted a scene of horse racing,5,5,2,,"Happy to be able to participate! I think some of the questions could be better worded however -  it dwas unclear exactly what the referece was in the second page and 2A. And the term ""imaginings"" was not entirerly linked in. "

26,2,1,4,4,1,5,1,1,1,Br4,"A broad river, intensely blue, the sensation of floating along it. That occurred for a second - while, but mostly I thought only of the music as music. Also, somewhat I let my imagination loose on the ideas of what it must have felt when to compose it.

Will we learn of the results and analysis? Thank you! 
28,1,1,1,4,1,5,1,1,1,,I thought about when I played this piece and how much more difficult it is than these wonderful musicans made it sound. ,5,5,5,,Not fictional ,,,,I thought the second movement was a little fast! ,I think this kind of imagaining might be more prevalent listening to recordings. In a live performance one wants to attend to the immediecy of the experience. 
29,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,,No memories at all. The music (Brahms) was just gorgeous - all consuming. There is no room for anything outside the music. It creates its now vast sapcea nd then unfolds within + beyond that. It is beyond the time of memories or imaginings. ,1,1,1,,None at all ,1,1,1,,Yes! I don't know how this research will reveal interesting results. Any non-verbal art will suggest memories if that is what you are looking for but how is listening to music different?

",3,1,1,Br2; Br3,"I didn't have a vivid scene, mostly because I was distracted by a clanging cane down in the front row banging the floor.

36,3,2,2,3,2,4,3,3,2,Br2,It reminds me when I was helping a young cellist to learn the 2nd mvt.

42,4,1,1,4,5,5,4,2,4,Br3,"Brahms was the first classical composer I fell in love with; this and his string sextet accompanied me on a long drive once to my dear friends Shawn and Lauren, on a frigid January day a few years ago; Perfect music for a 95 minute drive to Mahwah. I played this movement for them; they marvelled at its modernity.",4,4,5,Br2,"Slow movements always inspire the most vivid scenes; I've long wanted to make a film about Brahm's relationship with Clara Schumann after Robert admitted himself to a mental hospital. This seems like an accompaniment for a scene of Brahms writing a passionate yet restrained note to Clara, one of the famous ones declaring love, admiration, and friendship for her (if I remember correctly). If I don't, then this is what the story would be. ",4,4,5,"Seeing Mr. Hogue play was revalatory; he looks a bit like Osker Werner, who starred in several films by Francois Truffaut; Truffaut always reminds me of Brahms, and vice versa; the first movement is thrilling.
